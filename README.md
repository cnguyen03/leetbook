## Inspiration
As I practiced solving problems on Leetcode, I took notes about each problem on an Excel sheet so that I may revisit it if I approach the same or a similar problem.
However, as the number of problems I solved increased, so did the number of rows and text on my Excel sheet. I found it a little tedious to scroll down to enter
notes for a new problem and had trouble reading small notes that were surrounded by other texts and rows. So I decided to build a web app that allows you to
easily add and find notes for any problem you decide to solve. 

Leetbook is CRUD web app that holds all your notes for Leetcode problems on a simple, easy to access interface. I plan to 
build searching and categorizing capabilities as well as incorporate a database for users to save and retrieve data.

I am building this app to not only create an easier, more accessible way for users to access their notes for Leetcode, but also to practice and learn
new skills with frontend and backend technologies. I hope to come out of building this personal project with a refined knowledge of creating web applications
with frameworks and using databases to store and retrieve information.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
Backend: Firebase
