# Leetbook

This repository holds the source code of Leetbook, which is currently being made with React, Vite, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS
Leetbook is a notebook that holds all your notes for your Leetcode problems on a simple, easy to access interface. I plan to 
build search and categorizing capabilities as well as user authentification for users to save data.
