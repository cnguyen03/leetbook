# Leetbook

This repository holds the source code of Leetbook, which is currently being made with React, Vite, TypeScript, TailwindCSS for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.

Leetbook is CRUD app that holds all your notes for your Leetcode problems on a simple, easy to access interface. I plan to 
build search and categorizing capabilities as well as user authentification and a database for users to save and retrieve data.
